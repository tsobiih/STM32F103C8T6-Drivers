# STM32F103C8T6-Drivers
Bare-metal STM32 Drivers (STM32F103C8T6) Implementation of low-level drivers written from scratch for STM32F103C8T6 (medium density). Includes RCC, GPIO, SysTick, ADC (tested with potentiometer), SPI, and TFT (ported from STM32F401). Upcoming: NVIC, CAN driver, and a final project demonstrating CAN communication.
